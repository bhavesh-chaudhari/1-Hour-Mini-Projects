## Descriptions -

### Dark Mode
Simple Dark Mode Page using HTML, CSS and JS.
### Background Gif on Button and Text Glow
Glowing text animation with CSS and using gif in button background.
### Random Image Animation and Anime Images Api
Fetching data from [Waifu Pics Api](https://waifu.pics/) and using pics in carousel that gives random pic animation from any of the 4 sides of carousel.
### Simple Text Analyzer
Counting the number of words, letters and emails in the given text. 
### Edit Image Source and Custom Context Menu
Giving an option to change the image source and making custom context menu on right click. The idea of making custom context menu can be very useful at times. Some of the interesting things we can do with it is making a custom menu for video player or context menus like we see in figma, g-slides, etc.
### Particle JS Example
[Particle JS](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/) is a lightweight JavaScript Library that enables us to create particles on HTML canvas and do some really cool stuff with particles without actually having us to deal with canvas. Using this, many cool interactive animations can be made on hovering or clicking some field in website.
